# kotlin-template

An empty Kotlin project with sensible defaults.

Perfect for quick projects, coding workshops or as the basis for something bigger.

## What's included

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as a build tool
* [Spek](https://github.com/spekframework/spek) for unit tests
* [Hamkrest](https://github.com/npryce/hamkrest) for assertions
* [mockito-kotlin](https://github.com/nhaarman/mockito-kotlin) for mocking

## Usage

### Building the application

`./gradlew build`

### Running the tests

`./gradlew check`

Or, to run the tests once and then automatically re-run them when the code changes:

`./gradlew --continuous check`
